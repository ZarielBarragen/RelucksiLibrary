        <h2>What is Relucksi?</h2>
        <p><strong>ReLucksi is...</strong></p>
        <p>A card game set in a fictional universe I made up. Humans were granted magic in the form of a face pased, live battle card game by who they assumed to be a Goddess, Relucksi. <br> She named the card game after herself.</p>
        
        <p><strong>How do you play?</strong></p>
        <p>Each deck has a max of 24 cards <br>
            - You can only use a card once in battle unless the card is stated otherwise <br>
            - There will be card "Formats" (Ranged, Summoner, Trap, Etc.) and card "Types/Elements" (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Etc.) <br>
            - Each person that participates in this "game" must wear a device on their wrist. This device holds your deck, allows you to draw cards, and it magically shuffles your deck. <br> This is to keep you on your toes during battles (and to stop cheating as you're not supposed to know what cards you'll be getting next). <br> You cannot remove the device no matter what. <br>
            - Cards are hidden around the world, but if one would like to make their own cards, <br> they can ask the higher being and she will appoint them as a "Cardsmith," someone who creates cards to sell. <br>
            - Since cards in this universe works like spells/magic, there will be no "spell" types <br>
            - This game isn't turn based, all attacks are done in real time <br>
            - Every player has a different amount of overall health points. Lowest possible being 1000, Highest being 1,000,000 and the average being 4000.
