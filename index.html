        <h2>What is Relucksi?</h2>
        <p><strong>Relucksi is...</strong></p>
        <p>A card game set in a fictional universe I made up. Humans were granted magic in the form of a fast pased, live battle card game by who they assumed to be a Goddess, Relucksi. <br> She named the card game after herself.</p>
        
        <p><strong>How do you play?</strong></p>
        <p> - Each deck has a max of 24 cards <br>
            - You can only use a card once in battle unless the card is stated otherwise <br>
            - There will be card "Formats" (Ranged, Summoner, Trap, Etc.) and card "Types/Elements" (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Etc.) <br>
            - Each person that participates in this "game" must wear a device on their wrist. This device holds your deck, allows you to draw cards, and it magically shuffles your deck. <br> This is to keep you on your toes during battles (and to stop cheating as you're not supposed to know what cards you'll be getting next). <br> You cannot remove the device no matter what. <br>
            - Cards are hidden around the world, but if one would like to make their own cards, <br> they can ask the higher being and she will appoint them as a "Cardsmith," someone who creates cards to sell. <br>
            - Since cards in this universe works like spells/magic, there will be no "spell" types <br>
            - This game isn't turn based, all attacks are done in real time <br>
            - Every player has a different amount of overall health points. Lowest possible being 1000, Highest being 1,000,000 and the average being 4000. <br>
            - You are allowed to draw up to 4 cards at the start of your turn, after that, it maxes out at 2 everytime you use at least 2 cards. <br>
            - To determine a winner, the fighters decide. But if no conditions are made, its when you run out of cards. <br>
            - While yes this is a card, magic, game, thing, theres no one stopping you from actually using your hands and feet to start fighting <br>
            - You can only hold a max of 4 cards in your hand, and have a max of 3 cards in your "Save for later" slot <br>
        </p>

        <p><strong>How do Cards work?</strong></p>
        <p>Magicccc (and also the way it says to activate it on the card)</p>

        <p><strong>What are card Formats?</strong></p>
        <p>Basically what the card in itself actually does. Here are what they are: <br>
            •	Ranged: These cards allow for attacks from a distance, potentially hitting multiple targets or specific areas. <br>
            •	Summoner: Summon creatures or entities to the battlefield with various abilities and stats. <br>
            •	Trap: Activated under certain conditions, affecting opponents or altering the state of the game. <br>
            •	Enhancer: Temporarily boost a player's abilities or strengthen other cards in play. <br>
            •	Defender: Focus on protection and defense, blocking or reducing incoming damage. <br>
            •	Manipulator: Alter the flow of the game by changing the rules, such as affecting turn order, reshuffling decks, or swapping cards. <br>
            •	Bane: Specifically designed to counter or nullify certain card types or elements, adding a strategic layer to deck building. <br>

        </p>

        <p><strong>What are card Elements?</strong></p>
        <p>You know what they are in a card game, dont be stupid. Here are the types of elements cards can have:
            -	Fire: Focus on aggressive and powerful attack spells. Can cause lingering damage over time. <br>
            -	Water: Specialize in adaptability and flow, with abilities to heal and cleanse. <br>
        -	Earth: Emphasize strength and resilience, with a focus on defense and endurance. <br>
        -	Air: Prioritize speed and evasion, with quick strikes and abilities to dodge attacks. <br>
        -	Light: Associated with healing and protection, offering buffs and defensive barriers. <br>
        -	Darkness: Deceptive and cunning, with spells to weaken opponents or hide one's own actions. <br>
        -	Metal: Durable and unyielding, offering strong defenses and powerful, focused attacks. <br>
        -	Nature: Connected to life and growth, with abilities to regenerate and summon creatures. <br>
        -	Ether: Ethereal and mystical, with unpredictable effects and manipulation of game mechanics. <br>
        -	Chaos: Wild and uncontrollable, with high-risk, high-reward spells that can affect all players unpredictably. <br>
        -	Ice: Specializing in control and stasis, these cards could slow down opponents or freeze actions temporarily. <br>
        -	Lightning: Focused on swift and high-energy attacks, often with chain effects that can strike multiple targets. <br>
        -	Psychic: Involved in manipulation and mind control, potentially altering opponents' decisions or revealing their strategies. <br>
        -	Time: Revolving around temporal manipulation, allowing for actions like delaying opponent moves or repeating past actions. <br>
        -	Cosmic: Drawing on celestial power, these cards might involve unpredictable, large-scale effects. <br>
        -	Toxic: Centered around decay and poison, these could weaken opponents over time or corrupt other elements. <br>
        -	Mystic: Tied to ancient and arcane powers, offering complex but powerful spells that require careful planning. <br>
